# Download Feature Security Documentation

## Overview

The image download feature uses a secure service worker architecture to download and zip images in the background. This implementation prioritizes security, performance, and user experience.

## Security Measures

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **URL Validation**: Only HTTPS/HTTP URLs are allowed
- **MIME Type Whitelist**: Only approved image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG, BMP)
- **Filename Sanitization**: Removes dangerous characters, limits length
- **Array Validation**: Validates image array structure and content

### 2. Resource Limits

- **File Size Limit**: 50MB maximum per image
- **Total Size Limit**: 500MB maximum per download session
- **Image Count Limit**: 100 images maximum per request
- **Concurrent Downloads**: Limited to 3 simultaneous downloads
- **Timeout Protection**: 30-second timeout per image download

### 3. Request Security

- **CORS Mode**: Uses 'cors' mode for cross-origin requests
- **No Credentials**: Explicitly omits credentials in requests
- **User Agent**: Identifies as 'ImageCrawlerBot/1.0'
- **Abort Controllers**: Proper cleanup and cancellation support

### 4. Content Security

- **Content-Type Validation**: Validates response headers
- **Size Verification**: Double-checks file size after download
- **Error Isolation**: Individual image failures don't stop entire download
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of blob URLs and resources

## Architecture Components

### Service Worker (`public/download-worker.js`)

**Responsibilities:**
- Background image downloading
- ZIP file creation with metadata
- Security validation and filtering
- Progress reporting
- Resource cleanup

**Security Features:**
- Isolated execution context
- No access to main thread DOM
- Controlled message passing interface
- Automatic resource limits enforcement

### Download Service (`src/utils/downloadService.ts`)

**Responsibilities:**
- Service worker communication
- Progress tracking and UI updates
- Error handling and user feedback
- Download state management

**Security Features:**
- Request ID validation
- Single download session enforcement
- Automatic cleanup on errors
- Secure blob URL handling

### Security Configuration (`src/utils/securityConfig.ts`)

**Responsibilities:**
- Centralized security constants
- Validation utility functions
- Security audit logging
- Violation detection and reporting

## User Experience Protections

### 1. UI State Management

- **Button Disabling**: Prevents multiple simultaneous downloads
- **Progress Indication**: Real-time download progress display
- **Cancel Functionality**: Allows users to abort downloads
- **Error Feedback**: Clear error messages and recovery options

### 2. Resource Management

- **Automatic Cleanup**: Cleans up resources on component unmount
- **Memory Efficiency**: Streams large files without loading into memory
- **Background Processing**: Non-blocking UI during downloads
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with partial downloads on errors

## Potential Security Risks & Mitigations

### 1. Large File Attacks
**Risk**: Malicious sites serving extremely large images
**Mitigation**: File size limits (50MB per image, 500MB total)

### 2. Infinite Download Loops
**Risk**: Endless download requests
**Mitigation**: Image count limits, timeout controls, single session enforcement

### 3. Malicious Content
**Risk**: Non-image files disguised as images
**Mitigation**: MIME type validation, content-type header checking

### 4. Memory Exhaustion
**Risk**: Too many concurrent downloads consuming memory
**Mitigation**: Concurrent download limits, streaming downloads, automatic cleanup

### 5. Cross-Origin Attacks
**Risk**: Unauthorized access to user data
**Mitigation**: CORS mode, no credentials, isolated service worker context

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

1. **Never bypass security validations**
2. **Always handle download errors gracefully**
3. **Monitor resource usage in production**
4. **Keep security limits updated based on usage patterns**
5. **Test with various image sizes and formats**

### For Users

1. **Download button is disabled during active downloads**
2. **Cancel downloads if they take too long**
3. **Check available disk space before large downloads**
4. **Be aware that some images may fail to download**

## Monitoring & Logging

The system logs the following security events:

- Download attempt initiation
- Security violations (oversized files, invalid types)
- Download completion statistics
- Error conditions and failures

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user download rate limits
2. **Virus Scanning**: Integrate with antivirus APIs for downloaded content
3. **Content Analysis**: Advanced image content validation
4. **User Preferences**: Configurable download limits per user
5. **Analytics**: Download success/failure metrics

## Testing Security

To test the security measures:

1. **Large File Test**: Try downloading images > 50MB
2. **Invalid MIME Test**: Attempt to download non-image files
3. **Concurrent Limit Test**: Start multiple downloads simultaneously
4. **Timeout Test**: Download from very slow servers
5. **Malformed URL Test**: Use invalid or malicious URLs

## Emergency Procedures

If security issues are discovered:

1. **Immediate**: Disable download feature via feature flag
2. **Short-term**: Update security limits and validations
3. **Long-term**: Review and enhance security architecture
4. **Communication**: Notify users of any security incidents

## Compliance Notes

This implementation follows web security best practices:

- Content Security Policy (CSP) compatible
- No eval() or unsafe code execution
- Proper CORS handling
- Secure service worker implementation
- Privacy-respecting (no user data collection)
